## Development Workflow

### For Each Milestone

#### 1. Planning Session (30 minutes)
- Review specific components/features for the milestone
- Identify dependencies and order of implementation
- Set clear success criteria
- Identify potential challenges

#### 2. Implementation (Daily sessions)
- Build code in logical chunks
- Focus on one major feature per session
- Implement with quality and testing in mind
- Document any deviations from original specs

#### 3. Testing & Refinement
- Test each feature as it's built
- Gather feedback and make adjustments
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Verify real-time functionality

#### 4. Documentation Updates
